<h1 id="settingupmyenvoinment">Setting up my Envoinment</h1>

<p>Setting up my envionment I need to consider some of my goals for this project.
* I want to create something that could be integated to a larger site in the future.
* I want to be able to test on multiple browsers during my development process.
* I want to save my progress or versions incase I lose my code or make a mistake. </p>

<p>I choase to solve these issues by organizing my co
I set up a virtual machine so as i bult the site I could easly preview in IE8 and Chrome. Since IE8 is the oldest browser and most likely to not support newer code styles I wanted to keep my attention on that browser. Additionally, becasue I wanted to keep my code semantic and accessile I made sure I used the HTML5 element tags, alt tags(for my images), and additional notation for screen readers. Another area I added imprvment was by applying a SMACSS style organization to my Sass. I feel this keeps my code easy to naviagte and easy to template across a larger project. Additionally, I wrote my own grid and I used percentage used percentage veriables which would make expanding this site to be responsive even easier.</p>

<h2 id="carousel">Carousel</h2>

<ul>
<li>Add pagination dots to the carousel that update as the carousel rotates</li>
<li>Add the previous and next arrows to the carousel that bring the user to the previous or next slide.
When I examined the carouel code, I mapped out an outline of how I would figure out how to use the provided code. I first noticed that the carousel was already looping and would stop if the couser was hovering over the carousel image area. I looked at how the controlls were bound to the event listener, how they were triggered, and what actions they performed. My first task was to bind the &#8220;next&#8221; and &#8220;prev&#8221; buttons to event listeners. I chose the &#8220;mousedown&#8221; trigger so that it would not conflict with the &#8220;mouseover&#8221; and &#8220;mouseleave&#8221; triggers also it seems to be the most practicle becasue the name mimics a user action if someone saw an arrow button. While looking for the correct varaibles to use I utilized the Chrome developer tools console frequently to see what each object and function could return. For the pagination dots I was able to utlize a similar pattern that already exhisted to loop though the list of dots similar to the way the carosel was looping thouh the list of pictures.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="media">Media</h2>

<p>When I examined the Photoshop comp, I was able to extract the files for the media by grabing the layers in Photoshop and saving them to their own PNG format. I saved all the files to PNG for consistency, making sure pictures and approptately compressed for the web, and to maintain transperencey for files without backgrounds. Additionally, If I needed to support retina display I would have looked into getting higher resolution graphics and swapped out the higher resolution in a media query. Additionally, If I had the font installed on my computer I would have been able to convert the logo and vector art to SVG. Again, I would have included a SVG version of the video player and logo with a media query as IE8 does not support but it would have been another opportunity for progressive enhancement.</p>

<h2 id="form">Form</h2>

<ul>
<li>Marked up appropriately to be a functional form
After my first pass at styling some of the features on the form I realized that not all browsers treated the form elements the same so it would make pixel perfect a bit more difficult. I attempted to make the form the most like the Photoshop comp in IE8 and then I enhanced the visuals for the more modern day browsers with box shadows and placeholder text.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="designassumptionsbuttonsandstates">Design Assumptions Buttons and States</h2>

<p>While Pixel Perfection was the goal I noticed a pattern with the primary navigation having an normal state, a hover state, and an active state. So I made some design assumtions and applied these states to the other buttons and actions on the site.</p>
